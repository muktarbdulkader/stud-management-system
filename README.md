# Student Management System

## Project Description

### Problem Diagnosis

Managing student records, tracking performance, and ensuring seamless communication between students, teachers, and parents are critical tasks in educational institutions. However, these processes are often plagued by inefficiencies and disorganization, leading to significant challenges:

1. **Reliance on outdated systems**: Many institutions still use paper-based records or outdated software, which are prone to data loss, mismanagement, and inefficiencies.
2. **Lack of real-time access**: Students, parents, and teachers often struggle to access updated academic information, creating a disconnect between stakeholders.
3. **Administrative inefficiencies**: Tasks like fee collection, attendance tracking, grade calculation, and scheduling are time-consuming and error-prone when done manually.
4. **Absence of a unified platform**: There is no centralized system for sharing announcements, assignments, or performance updates, leading to delays and miscommunication.
